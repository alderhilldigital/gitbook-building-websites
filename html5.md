# HTML5

Sir Tim Berners-Lee came up with a concept called “HTML Tags” based on the Standard Generalised Markup Language \(SGML\). Other markup languages like XML where also based on SGML. HTML 2.0 was the first official specification.

The latest version of HTML is HTML5 and still uses the same syntax structure with some additional tag names added. The other main landmark HTML versions are HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01 and XHTML.
