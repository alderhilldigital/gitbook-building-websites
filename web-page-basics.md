# Web Page Basics

Websites can be used for many different purposes. Promotional websites are used to advertise products, companies, and services. E-commerce websites are used to store and manage details of commercial transactions. Information websites are used to catalogue and reference information for it's users. Lots of other types of websites exist including, journalism and blogging, social media, games and entertainment, web-based applications and new ideas for uses of websites appear on a regular basis. Websites are a structured collection of documents that are linked to one another. 

Web pages are documents written in the HTML language. They also use other languages to style them and make them functional. To view a web page you need a programme that can read and interpret HTML. The most common type of viewer that can convert HTML into a formatted document is a web browser e.g. Google Chrome. The pages can contain different types of media including text, pictures and video. Once a web page is created it can be made accessible to the world via the internet.

When a web page is converted from an HTML document to be viewable in a web browser there is no more communication back to the source of the HTML document. This is known as a "stateless" architecture. The web browser sends a request for a web page to wherever the source file is stored and the source file is returned and displayed in the web browser. If the source file is updated the page displayed in the web browser will NOT change unless another request to the source is made.
