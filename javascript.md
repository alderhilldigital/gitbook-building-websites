# Javascript

Javascript is programming language commonly used along side HTML to enable certain types of functionality for web pages. There have been various versions of Javascript since it's initial release in 1996. Around 2005 some Javascript frameworks started to emerge including JQuery and Prototype. Javascript implements object-oriented and event-driven methodologies. Here are some definitions that will help when learning Javascript.

**Object** - An element of a programme that represents a particular entity.  
**Property** - An attribute of an object that can be assigned a value.  
**Function** - An encapsulated part of a programme that receives, processes and may return data.  
**Method** - A function that is associated with an object.  
**Variable** - A temporary store for data that can be used at other points in the programme.  
**Event** - An encapsulation of the data that is captured during an action. e.g. mouse click

**Example**

An object could represent a person. A property of that person could be their name. A Method of that person could be "Wave".
